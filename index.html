         <p> When asked to create a tribute page as part of my HTML and CSS learning, I couldn't really think of who to use. Eventually I decided to stick to what I know and love so introducing Dottie and Dashie (Dash)</p><div class="dash">
         <h2>Introducing Dash</h2>
         
<ul class="keyfactsdash"><h3>Key Info</h3>
  <li>Birthday 10th September. This year she will be 2 years old</li>
  <li>Unknown breed but she was advertised as a cocker spaniel</li>
  <li>Dash is a rescue pup who had a bad start to life. She moved in with us when she was 6 months old.</li></ul>
<div class="dashdescrip"><p>Dash, also known as Dashie, Dashpot, Meathead, Bubblebutt and Little one spent the first months of her life basically alone. Her owner worked all hours and had no time for her. He has never admitted to abuse but her behvaiour, dislike of men, flinching at sudden movements (especially hands) makes us believe she was beaten. I had been on the market for a rescue pup for a while and was contacted by a rescue organisation to see if I was interested in a Cocker Spaniel. Jumping at the chance I contacted the owner, offering a meet and greet and to see where she would be living. Despite numerous offers he was not interested in seeing her new home and just wanted her gone that day. </p>
<p>After agreeing to meet halfway to introduce her to Dottie, we drove and met in Lidl's carpark. This waggy tailed creature climbed out of the car and we had cuddles and said our hello's. Happy to continue with the introduction we went to get Dottie from the car to introduce them. As we turned round we saw her first owner getting in the car and driving away. I guess we had a new dog!</p>

  <h2>Introducing Dottie</h2>         
<ul class="keyfactsdash"><h3>Key Info</h3>
  <li>Birthday 20th September. This year she will be 4 years old</li>
  <li>She is a pure Springer Spaniel from champion lines. Find out more about Springers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Springer_Spaniel" id="tribute-link" target="_blank">here</a></li>
  <li>Dottie moved with us from the UK to Portugal in 2020, surviing a 29 hour drive!</li></ul>
  <div class="dottie"><p>Dottie also know as Dotpot, Wigglebutt, Precious Pea, Cuddle Monster, Mind-Out! and Bubblebutt was my first ever dog. For years we had been looking at rescuing in the UK but kept getting turned down because I worked (although my father was basically retired) had a small garden and numerous other reasons, we eventually decided to buy from a reputable breeder. With our hearts set on a Border Collie, we searched high and low for an upcoming litter but kept being pipped to the post. One day and advert popped up for a little of Springers, only a couple left. Straight on the phone I arranged to visit the next day.<br>
  Everyone says love at first sight, that really is true. Walking into this pile of tiny squishy little things, I sat down ready to be clambered over. One chunky butt little thing stumbled over to my father and attacked his foot, biting and chewing him. She then turned round and stumbled over to me, climbed on my lap and promptly fell asleep. From that moment Dottie became family and to this day she is a crazy bundle of nuttiness ready to attack followed by a good cuddle and a nap!</p>
